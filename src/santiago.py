"""The FreedomBuddy (FBuddy) service.

Santiago is designed to let users negotiate services without third party
interference.  By sending OpenPGP signed and encrypted messages over HTTPS (or
other connectors) between parties, I hope to reduce or even prevent MITM
attacks.  Santiago can also use the Tor network as a proxy (with Python 2.7 or
later), allowing this negotiation to happen very quietly.

The first Santiago service queries another's index with a request.  That request
is handled and a request is returned.  Then, the reply is handled.  The upshot
is that we learn a new set of locations for the service.

:TODO: add doctests
:FIXME: allow multiple listeners and senders per connector (with different
    proxies)

This dead-drop approach is what came of my trying to learn from bug 4185.
