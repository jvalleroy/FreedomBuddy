* Issue

  FreedomBuddy doesn't know a thing about (PGP, or other) subkeys.  All it knows
  is the key used to sign the message.  If a user adds a subkey to their primary
  key, FreedomBuddy correctly determines that the subkey was not the key we
  agreed to exchange data with and hangs up.

   Right now, I have no idea what to do about this.  What is the correct fix?
   Do we even need a fix?  If I couldn't figure out why I couldn't exchange
   messages with myself after adding a signing subkey to my keyring, it's
   probably unexpected behavior.
